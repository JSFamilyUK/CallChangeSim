# Call Change Simulator User Guide

## Introduction

The Call Change Simulator is a web-based tool designed to help bell ringers practice and learn call changes. It provides a visual and auditory simulation of bell ringing, allowing users to practice different patterns and changes on various numbers of bells.

## Tips and Best Practices

   - Start with simple patterns like Rounds or Queens
   - Use the pattern highlighting to guide your changes
   - Practice making changes without playback first

2. **Using Playback**

   - Begin with slower changes to get comfortable
   - Use the Open Handstroke option for more realistic practice
   - Make changes during playback to practice timing

3. **Calling Down**

   - Remember to select the bell to move first
   - Then select where it should go
   - Use the Lead button for moving bells into lead position

4. **Troubleshooting**
   - If no sound plays, check your device's volume and silent mode
