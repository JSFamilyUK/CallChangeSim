            Now in a pop-out window not a single page
            Allows browsing of any number of bells and return to the sim without impact on playback or current changes being called
            Choose a pattern on the current number of bells to load it
            Choose a pattern on a different number of bells to set revised bell numbers as well as the new pattern
            Change to the number of bells triggered from the patterns dialogue will apply after the current sequence completes (Stand)
        - Options Dialogue - NEW
            Calling Up or Down
                Call Up as default 
                Call down option which loads additional "Lead" bell button in the bell selection area and adjusts logic branching / errors

                Moved to Options from the main screen. No functional change
            Offline Mode - NEW

                Switching the setting to On plays original tone based sounds - for no internet situations
            Spacial Bell Sounds - NEW
                Bells are spaced from 20 degrees to the left (Treble) to 20 degrees to the right (Tenor). 
                The interval is dependent on the number of bells
                The interval is fixed by bell number not position
                Provides stereo representation of ringing chamber positions
        - Bell Number Buttons
            The current number of bells in use is now highlighted in dark blue. 
            This is consistent with the buttons in the patterns dialogue
            Highlighting is properly managed to remain visible
            Changing the number of bells will cause the current sequence to Stand after completion
        - Bell Highlighting prompts / icons
            Icons are smaller with less text
            Both icons now fit on a single line above the current order bells
        - Current Order Bell Icons
            Slightly more oval default shape to reduce the visual impact of higher bell numbers reducing the icon width
            Bells 10, 11 and 12 are now displayed as 0, E and T
            Highlighting of recent swaps updates in line with calling down logic where the bells selected do not both move position
        - Stand Button Functionality Change
            The Stand button will turn red when pressed and will remain in that way until playback of the bells / tones stops
        - Horizontal Rule lines have been removed above and below the bell selection area
        - Bell Selection area
            Tite font has been adjusted and made more readable
            Icons have been replaced with bell numbers for usability
            The bell selection area is enclosed in a bespoke container for ease of identification
            Selected bells now have blue numbers (default is grey) and the highlight persists for 1sec after the bells swap
            The prompt for the target bell order when a patter is chosen is amended to show the pattern name as well as the bell order
            The prompt for the target bell order uses the new naming convention for bells 10, 11 and 12
            Errors have been updated to reflect calling up and calling down scenarios including where the bell in 2nds is being called into lead using the "Lead" button
        - Change History Table
            Title font has been adjusted and made more readable
            The Bell Order column uses the new naming convention for bells 10, 11 and 12
        - Live Bell Sounds / Playback
            Playback stopped by the Stand button will allow the current sequence to complete before playback actually ceases. The stand button will highlight dark red to confirm it has been pressed 
            Individual sound files for 12 bells obtained
                Source sounds are from St Magnus the Martyr (26cwt in D)
                Sound files pre-load when the page is opened 
            Duration values have been reduced as follows:
                05 Bells - 0.30 seconds
                06 Bells - 0.28 seconds 
                08 Bells - 0.26 seconds
                10 Bells - 0.24 seconds
                12 Bells - 0.22 seconds
            Bell sounds set to start playing according to the duration from the previous bell sound starting
            An individual Bell sound is not cut off by the next bell or by playback being stopped. Any bell sound already in progress will play in full
